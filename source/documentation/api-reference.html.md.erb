<%= partial 'partials/phase_banner' %>

## Endpoint overview 

There are two endpoints for submitting:

* [submit a new ENS declaration](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/import-control-entry-declaration-store/1.0#_submit-a-new-entry-summary-declaration-ens_post_accordion)
* [submit an ENS amendment to an existing declaration](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/import-control-entry-declaration-store/1.0#_amend-an-existing-entry-summary-declaration-ens_put_accordion)

There are three endpoints for getting outcomes of submissions:

* [get a list of outcomes](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/import-control-entry-declaration-outcome/1.0#_get-a-list-of-outcomes_get_accordion)
* [get a single outcome](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/import-control-entry-declaration-outcome/1.0#_retrieve-an-outcome_get_accordion)
* [acknowledge an outcome](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/import-control-entry-declaration-outcome/1.0#_acknowledge-an-outcome_delete_accordion)

There are three endpoints for notifications:

* [get a list of advanced notifications](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/import-control-entry-declaration-intervention/1.0#_get-a-list-of-notifications_get_accordion)
* [get a single advanced notification](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/import-control-entry-declaration-intervention/1.0#_retrieve-a-notification_get_accordion)
* [acknowledge a notification](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/import-control-entry-declaration-intervention/1.0#_acknowledge-a-notification_delete_accordion)



## Submitting a new ENS declaration

You can use this endpoint to create and submit a new Entry Summary Declaration (ENS).

```
POST /customs/imports/declarations
```

There is no SOAP header and the XML body envelope remains the same. It starts with a ```<ie:CC315A>``` element at the top level.

```
<ie:CC315A xmlns:ie="http://ics.dgtaxud.ec/CC315A">
   <MesSenMES3>GB1234231/1234567890</MesSenMES3>
   <MesRecMES6>ABCD1234</MesRecMES6>
   <DatOfPreMES9>091231</DatOfPreMES9>
   <TimOfPreMES10>2359</TimOfPreMES10>
   <MesIdeMES19>ABCD1234</MesIdeMES19>
   <MesTypMES20>CC315A</MesTypMES20>
   <HEAHEA>
    …
   </HEAHEA>
  …
</ie:CC315A>
```

The message sender element ```<MesSenMES3>``` contains your EORI. It is the same EORI that the authentication bearer token is based on.
The response returned confirms that we have received your submission and will contain a correlation ID:

```
<ns:SuccessResponse xmlns:ns="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/successresponse/2" xmlns="http://www.govtalk.gov.uk/enforcement/ICS/responsedata/7">
   <ns:ResponseData>
       <CorrelationId>0JRF7UncK0t004</CorrelationId>
   </ns:ResponseData>
</ns:SuccessResponse>
```

You can use the correlation ID to obtain your outcomes and acknowledge any outcomes that you get.

## Submitting a ENS amendment

You can use this endpoint to submit an amendment to an existing ENS.

```
<ie:CC313A xmlns:ie="http://ics.dgtaxud.ec/CC313A">
 <MesSenMES3>GBCD1234/1234567890</MesSenMES3>
 <MesRecMES6>GBC123</MesRecMES6>
 <DatOfPreMES9>030211</DatOfPreMES9>
 <TimOfPreMES10>0123</TimOfPreMES10>
 <MesIdeMES19>ABC123</MesIdeMES19>
 <MesTypMES20>CC313A</MesTypMES20>
 <CorIdeMES25>ABC123</CorIdeMES25>
 <HEAHEA>
   <DocNumHEA5>12AB3C4D5E6F7G8H90</DocNumHEA5>
    …
 </HEAHEA>
 …
</ie:CC313A>
```

The element ```<DocNumHEA5>``` holds the Movement Reference Number given to you as an outcome. The Movement Reference Number must match the ```{mrn}``` in the PUT path parameter:

```
PUT /customs/imports/declarations/{mrn}
```

A successful call will return a HTTP 200 response. 

```
<ns:SuccessResponse xmlns:ns="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/successresponse/2" xmlns="http://www.govtalk.gov.uk/enforcement/ICS/responsedata/7">
    <ns:ResponseData>
        <CorrelationId>87491122139921</CorrelationId>
    </ns:ResponseData>
</ns:SuccessResponse>
```

If the call is not successful a HTTP 400 response is returned with an XML error message.

## Getting outcomes

### Getting a list of outcomes

This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of unacknowledged outcomes. You will need to ensure that you retrieve a list of unacknowledged advanced notifications as well as outcomes.

```
GET /customs/imports/outcomes
```

In this example, there are two outcomes each contained within the ```<response>``` element:

```
<entryDeclarationResponses>
 <response>
   <correlationId>0JRF7UncK0t004</correlationId>
   <link>/customs/imports/outcomes/0JRF7UncK0t004</link>
   <MRN>10GB08I01234567891</MRN>
 </response>
 <response>
   <correlationId>0JRF7UncAqr004</correlationId>
   <link>/customs/imports/outcomes/0987654321</link>
 </response>
</entryDeclarationResponses>
```

Both have a ```<correlationId>``` element containing the correlation ID received with the original declaration:

```
<correlationId>0JRF7UncK0t004</correlationId>
…
<correlationId>0JRF7UncAqr004</correlationId>
```

The link within the ```<link>``` element can be used to fetch the detail or acknowledge the outcome:

```
<link>/customs/imports/outcomes/0JRF7UncK0t004</link>
```

Outcomes that are successful or accepted will have a Movement Reference Number inside the response:

```
<MRN>10GB08I01234567891</MRN>
```

Those that do not have a Movement Reference Number will be rejections, for example:

```
 <response>
   <correlationId>0JRF7UncAqr004</correlationId>
   <link>/customs/imports/outcomes/0987654321</link>
 </response>
```

### Getting an outcome

This endpoint is used to retrieve the details for an individual Entry Summary Declaration (ENS).

The path parameter contains the correlation ID that was returned in response to the  declaration itself:

```
GET /customs/imports/outcomes/{correlationId}
```

The returned XML is in the same format as the current system:

```
<outcomeResponse xmlns:cc3="http://ics.dgtaxud.ec/CC328A">
  <response>
    <cc3:CC328A>
      <MesSenMES3>GB000012340003/1234567890</MesSenMES3>
      <MesRecMES6>GB000012340003/1234567890</MesRecMES6>
      <MesIdeMES19>MSUI11235227</MesIdeMES19>
      <MesTypMES20>CC328A</MesTypMES20>
      <CorIdeMES25>0JRF7UncK0t004</CorIdeMES25>
      <HEAHEA>
        ...
        <DocNumHEA5>10GB08I01234567891</DocNumHEA5>
        ...
      </HEAHEA>
      ...
    </cc3:CC328A>
  </response>
  <acknowledgement method='DELETE' href='/customs/imports/outcomes/0JRF7UncK0t004'/>
</outcomeResponse>
```

A successful accepted outcome contains a Movement Reference Number within the ```<DocHumHEA5>``` element.
 
```
<DocNumHEA5>10GB08I01234567891</DocNumHEA5>
```

### Acknowledging an outcome

This endpoint allows you to acknowledge an existing outcome.

The path parameter is the same as that used for a GET however the HTTP method is now a DELETE:

```
DELETE /customs/imports/outcomes/{correlationId}
```

After calling this endpoint the outcome will no longer be retrievable and will no longer appear in the list of outcomes.

## Advanced notifications (Do not load) - IE351

### Get a list of advanced notifications - IE351

This endpoint allows a developer to retrieve a list of advanced notifications that are yet to be acknowledged.  
You will need to ensure that you retrieve a list of unacknowledged advanced notifications as well as outcomes.

```
GET /customs/imports/notifications
```

A successful response will return a list of identifiers for notifications to download
within the ```<response>``` element. Each item in the list contains a Notification ID that uniquely 
identifies the notification, along with the Correlation ID that identifies the ENS submission.
In this example two Notification IDs have been returned.

```
<advancedNotifications>
  <response>
    <correlationId>1234567890</correlationId>
    <notificationId>1D45fQ563</notificationId>
    <link>/customs/imports/notifications/1D45fQ563</link>
  </response>
  <response>
    <correlationId>0987654321</correlationId>
    <notificationId>ABx4414f4</notificationId>
    <link>/customs/imports/notifications/ABx4414f4</link>
  </response>
</advancedNotifications>
```

A HTTP 204 response indicates there are no notifications available to download.

### Retrieve a notification - IE351

This endpoint retrieves a notification for given Notification ID.

```
GET /customs/imports/notifications/{notificationId}
```

The XML returned is the same as the current system. An example of a successful response:

```
<notificationResponse xmlns:cc3="http://ics.dgtaxud.ec/CC351A">
  <response>
    <cc3:CC351A>
      <MesSenMES3>GBCD1234/1234567890</MesSenMES3>
      <MesRecMES6>GBC123</MesRecMES6>
      <DatOfPreMES9>030211</DatOfPreMES9>
      <TimOfPreMES10>0123</TimOfPreMES10>
      <MesIdeMES19>ABC123</MesIdeMES19>
      <MesTypMES20>CC313A</MesTypMES20>
      <CorIdeMES25>ABC123</CorIdeMES25>
      ...
      <CUSINT632>
        <IteNumConCUSINT668>1</IteNumConCUSINT668>
        <CusIntCodCUSINT665>A001</CusIntCodCUSINT665>
        <CusIntTexCUSINT666>ABC12</CusIntTexCUSINT666>
        <CusIntTexCUSINT667LNG>en</CusIntTexCUSINT667LNG>
      </CUSINT632>
    </cc3:CC351A>
  </response>
  <acknowledgement method='DELETE' href='/customs/imports/notifications/0JRF7UncK0t004'/>
</notificationResponse>
```

A HTTP 404 response indicates there are no details currently available for the given Notification ID.

### Acknowledge a notification - IE351 

This endpoint allows a developer to acknowledge the receipt of an advanced notification response for a given Notification ID.

```
DELETE /customs/imports/notifications/{notificationId}
```

A HTTP 200 response indicates the acknowledgement request has been accepted.  A HTTP 404 response indicates there are no details available for the given Notification ID.
